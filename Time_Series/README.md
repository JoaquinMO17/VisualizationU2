# Cryptocurrency Spatiotemporal Analysis

A comprehensive data analysis project examining the relationship between global search interest patterns and cryptocurrency price volatility across multiple countries and digital assets.

## Project Overview

This project investigates the spatiotemporal dynamics of cryptocurrency markets by integrating:
- **Geographic search interest data** from Google Trends (2020-2025)
- **Price and volatility data** for five major cryptocurrencies
- **Statistical time series analysis** including Random Walk tests, ACF, and Cross-Correlation Functions (CCF)

### Key Research Questions

1. Are cryptocurrency prices random walks? What does this imply for investing?
2. Does geographic search interest predict price volatility?
3. Which countries lead global cryptocurrency adoption trends?
4. How do different regions exhibit varying preferences between Bitcoin and altcoins?

## Cryptocurrencies Analyzed

- **Bitcoin (BTC)** - Market leader and benchmark
- **Ethereum (ETH)** - Smart contract platform
- **Cardano (ADA)** - Proof-of-stake blockchain
- **Dogecoin (DOGE)** - Meme-driven cryptocurrency
- **Ripple (XRP)** - Cross-border payment protocol

## Geographic Coverage

**10 Countries/Regions:** Brazil, China, Germany, Great Britain, India, Japan, South Korea, Mexico, Singapore, United States

## Key Findings

### 1. Random Walk Behavior
- **BTC, ETH, ADA, XRP** exhibit non-stationary behavior (p-value > 0.05), confirming random walk properties
- **DOGE** shows stationary tendencies, suggesting mean-reverting behavior
- **Implication:** Traditional technical analysis may have limited predictive power for most cryptocurrencies

### 2. Volatility Clustering
- All cryptocurrencies display significant volatility clustering (autocorrelation in squared returns)
- Periods of high volatility tend to follow high volatility periods
- Justifies use of ARCH/GARCH models for risk forecasting

### 3. Search Interest as a Leading Indicator
- **Global Bitcoin search interest predicts volatility** with a 1-week lead (negative lag in CCF)
- Contemporaneous correlation: r = 0.47 between interest and volatility
- Search spikes precede major price movements, making interest data valuable for early warning systems

### 4. Geographic Leadership
- **United States** emerges as the strongest leading indicator (correlation: 0.78 at lag -1)
- Strong synchronized behavior among developed markets (US, Germany, Japan, Great Britain)
- China and some emerging markets show more idiosyncratic patterns

### 5. Altcoin Preference Patterns
- **South Korea (70.1%)** and **Japan (68.7%)** show highest altcoin preference ratios
- **United States (55.8%)** and **China (58.7%)** remain more Bitcoin-focused
- Regional preferences suggest varying risk appetites and market maturity levels

## Installation

   - Lead/lag relationship identification
   - Investment strategy recommendations

## Methodology

### Time Series Analysis
- **Random Walk Test:** Augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF) test on closing prices
- **Volatility Measurement:** Squared log returns as proxy for volatility
- **Autocorrelation:** ACF analysis on prices, returns, and squared returns

### Spatial Analysis
- **Data Source:** Google Trends weekly search volume (scaled 0-100)
- **Aggregation:** Country-level and global averages with 4-6 week moving averages
- **Correlation Heatmaps:** Pearson correlation matrices for country co-movement

### Spatiotemporal Integration
- **Cross-Correlation Function (CCF):** Identifies lead/lag relationships between:
  - Volatility (X) vs. Global Interest (Y)
  - Country Interest (X) vs. Global Interest (Y)
- **Statistical Significance:** 95% confidence intervals (¬±2/‚àöN)

## Investment Implications

### Strategy Recommendations

1. **Contrarian Signal (Interest as Lagging Indicator)**
   - High public euphoria following price moves may indicate market tops
   - Use search interest spikes as warning signals for overbought conditions

2. **Leading Country Monitoring**
   - Track US search interest as a 1-week leading indicator
   - Sustained increases in US interest may signal broader global adoption
   - Potential buy signal before wider market participation

3. **Regional Diversification**
   - Consider geographic variations in cryptocurrency preferences
   - Altcoin-focused regions (Korea, Japan) may signal early trends in alternative assets

## Limitations

- Google Trends data is normalized and relative, not absolute
- Search interest ‚â† actual trading volume or capital flows
- Analysis covers 2020-2025; market dynamics may evolve
- Correlation does not imply causation
- External factors (regulation, macroeconomic events) not fully captured

## Future Work

- Expand to additional cryptocurrencies and countries
- Integrate social media sentiment analysis
- Incorporate macroeconomic variables (inflation, interest rates)
- Develop predictive machine learning models
- Real-time monitoring dashboard
